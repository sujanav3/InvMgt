To communicate with git hub server we need GitBash
Open GitBash.
Navigate to the directory 'GitPractice'
Git config user name, email id
Git init  - It will initialize empty repo in your local system
Git Remote Add Origin - to establish connection to the remote repository server
git remote add origin https://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@github.com/sujanav3/InvMgt.git

from git hub server, open the repository.click on code.copy the Https URL
git clone  https://github.com/sujanav3/InvMgt.git this will copy the code first time from server to local repo
Under the folder GitPractice a folder InvMgt will be created.now code is avialble in your workstation under the folder InvMgt.make any changes that you want to make to the code
Note: 1.Git clone(first time when code code is not present in your local system then do clone)
   or 2.Git pull(code exists in local workstation.to get updated code from server ues this pull)
Change the directory to InvMgt
git commit -am "updated comments in server.js"  this will Update the changes from your work station to local repository (not to the server repository)
git push origin master - updated code will be pushed to remote server repository

At the time of push it will ask you to enter(signin) Token.

Next time onwards to get the code from server no need to do Git Clone. Do Git pull

-------------
git remote add origin https://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@github.com/sujanav3/InvMgt.git
git clone  https://github.com/sujanav3/InvMgt.git 
git commit -am "Practice updated comments in server.js"
git log -- follow server.js
git tag 7f2861543df1d06a87509992954d405c579d0b66 
git push origin master



Question
1.Git clone should be run at directory where invMgt is present
git pull should be run at invMgt? not at the directoy above it. correct??
